# Static docs

This contains the barebones directory of the documentation, including

- The directory structure generated by sphinx-quickstart, including:
  - Makefiles 
  - conf.py
- The static documentation files (index.rst, etc.)
- The bibliography

This will be copied (by the Makefile) into the *untracked* `docs/` directory.
The `docs/` directory contains the generated documentation.

**Warning:** Nothing should be manually added to the `docs/` directory, but instead added here. The `docs/` directory is *untracked*, and will be *wiped* by a `make clean`
